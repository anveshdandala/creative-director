<!-- >Lab: Create a chatbot with IBM Watsonx Assistant<-->

IBM watsonx Assistant, focused on using actions to build customer conversations, is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. Building, testing, publishing, and analyzing your assistant can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.

You can use IBM watsonx Assistant to build your own branded live chatbot into any device, application, or channel. Your chatbot, which is also known as an assistant, connects to the customer engagement resources you already use to deliver an engaging, unified problem-solving experience to your customers.

# Learning objectives

After completing this lab, you should be able to:
- Sign up for an IBM Cloud account and provision the IBM watsonx Assistant service.
- Create an assistant.
- Add an action to your assistant based on a template.
- Add an action to your assistant starting from scratch.
- Extract information in session variables.
- Contrast various response types.
- Add a custom extension with dynamic options.

<a name="task05d"></a>

## Task 5d: Explore conditions for handling responses

In Task 5a, you request a confirmation (Yes or No) response from the user; however, you don't treat the user's responses separately. In this scenario, the third step of the action is the end of the action, which should only be reached if the user agrees with the saved email.

1. In Step 3, from the _Is taken_ drop-down list, select **with conditions**.
2. Review the populated condition as _If All of this is true:_ **2\. Please confirm your email address** **is** **Yes**. <br/>![Hi action](images/wxa-hi-action-09.png "Hi action")<br/>The next case occurs when the user answers **No**; in which case we simply loop back and repeat the action from Step 1.
3. Click **New step**.
4. From the _Is taken_ drop-down list, **with conditions**.
5. Set the condition to _If All of this is true:_ **2\. Please confirm your email address** **is** **No**.

# Task 6: Explore response types

You can specify choices for the user to select as a response. In this task, you create an action with different response types.

<a name="task06a"></a>

Follow these steps to create an action with multiple example phrases that a user might type to initiate the conversation:

1. Click **New action** to create a another action for your assistant.
2. Choose **Start from scratch** to build an action based on your own use case.
3. Type the following for the text that your customer will use to start this interaction, and click **Save**.
   ```
   Hello, show me the different response types
   ```
   <br/><img src="images/wxa-response-types-01.png" width="40%" alt="Response types action" title="Response types action">
4. Click the **Customer starts with** section.
5. In the _Add example phrases_ section, add more example phrases that the customer might use to initiate the conversation. For example:
   ```
   What response types are available?
   ```
   Adding additional example phrases helps your assistant to better understand the customer's needs: <br/>![Response types action](images/wxa-response-types-02.png "Response types action")<br/>
   Now that watsonx Assistant knows how to start this action, you need to configure the steps that define the interaction between watsonx Assistant and the customer.
